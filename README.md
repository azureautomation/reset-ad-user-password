Reset AD User Password
======================

            

Use this Automation Runbook to reset the password of specific AD Users in a really easy way. In order for this to work, you need to delegate access to the OU to the computer account running the agent connected to Operations Management Suite. After this runbook
 is implemented, the rights to it can be delegated to given users who can then log on to the Azure portal and execute the runbook. This way you will have launched your own self-service password reset. Find more information at
[Github](https://github.com/DanielOrneling/OMS-Automation---Reset-AD-User-Password) and a complete setup guide from my blog [here](http://wp.me/p5vjxs-4wR).




 




        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
